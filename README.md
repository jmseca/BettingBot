From scratch ML models to predict the outcome of Football games in 7 differente leagues

## Note

I implemented all this code during the COVID-19 pandemic. From Mar 2020 to Sep 2020.
Before this project, I had only done a few, but very small, so this was a really big leap.

Furthermore, because I started this almost has a complete beginner, I had no Refactoring habits. This lead to the desorganization you can see.
I plan to organize it, one day.

And the comments are all in Portuguese (Pt) :(
